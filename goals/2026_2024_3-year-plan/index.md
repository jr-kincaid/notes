# My life purpose as defined by three year plan

I will endeavor in year 43, 44, 45 in my trips around the sun to favor consistency, sustainment, and experiences over space, urgency, and accommodating demands of others. Committing to Values is far more important than success and failure. There will always be joy and celebration but also sadness and regret. It’s all natural consequences of living.

# Values
Creator of Joy for those I care for.

Balance, Consistency, and Continuity of a Jewish Zen Lifestyle.

Art and Learning over toil and servitude.

Minimalism and Utilitarian Stoicism.

Coach, Volunteer, and Advocate Leader in the Community, Family, and in the World of Work.

Active mentor and Enabling Thought leader through content and estate creation personally, in the community, and professionally. Give back relentlessly.

Continued focus on the principles of Ray Dalio. Live my personality of an Artisan, Strategist, Orchestrator.

Continue to read amorously through my TBR. Commit to finishing books. Toss aside identified junk of what doesn’t feed me intellectually.

Write and produce content daily. Focus on values. Embrace supporters and form ability to take in feedback constructive and otherwise. Avoid agendas of the masses. Stay true to values.

Trust in my mentors professionally, spiritually, and among my true friends. Fire from my life anyone who is poison and let them live life however they choose. I do not need to engage or provide feedback unless I feel it would make a difference.
